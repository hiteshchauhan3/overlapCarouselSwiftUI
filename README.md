CarouselView Component

A modular, SwiftUI-based carousel with snapping, scaling, and a gentle bounce effect. Built for easy integration and customization, this component displays a horizontally scrollable set of items with dynamic scaling and page indicators.

Features

Snapping: Items snap to the nearest position when dragging ends.

Scaling: Centered item scales up while others shrink smoothly.

Bounce Effect: Gentle overscroll bounce at the ends using a spring animation.

Page Control: Customizable dot indicators to reflect the active item.

Modular Structure: Separated into CarouselView, CarouselContent, CarouselItemView, and PageControl for clarity and reusability.
